##### So What is this berrycraft-edit? #####
# I (dragoboss) edited a couple lines in this plugin version to better
# suit the BerryCraft server. I made the following edits:
#
# 1. using the shortcut of a channel without any message behind it now focuses
#    the channel instead of giving the message "/<channel> <message>"
# 2. using /spy (formerly /lc spy) now also turns on Essentials social-spy so that all chat
#    fuctions are spied on through both plugins instead of just half through either.
# 3. Edited the /mute plugin so we can move either /lc mute to /mute or keep using
#    the Essentials mute command.
# 4. Removed /ignore because of the Essentials built in exempt
# 5. Removed /afk because of the essentials built-in auto-status and auto-kick
# 6. now with 1.1.4 updated to 1.12
# 7. 1.1.5 add /setcolor command to set chat color.
#####          That is about it.       #####
